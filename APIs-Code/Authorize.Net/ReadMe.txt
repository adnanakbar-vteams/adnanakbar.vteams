These files are used to handle credit card transactions using Authorize.net APIs.

arb.class.php is the class file which help authenticate and transactions and cancellations of the auto recurring billings.
authenticate.php file is credit card transaction handling code
cancel.php file is used to cancel already done transactions or stop auto recurring billings.

I have worked with lot of other APIs like eBay (Build a system to post multiple products on eBay at once and reporting the existing products under certain accounts), FatSecret (To grab recipes and their Nutritional facts), WorldPay APIs (handled credit card transactions) and lot others.

Note: I dont usually keep codes of the projects with me but will try to write down some others and will upload here soon.
